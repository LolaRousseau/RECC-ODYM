Adding more flexibility
	- Rename population parameter
	- Changing 'Region32' to 'Region'
	- Loop for changes in several parameters to update the .dat file (instead of deleting .dat file and recreate it for just a few parameters)
	- Adding reb and nreb sections to be able to run then separately
	- Adding possibility to study individual drivers and export of the results (folder name)
	
Study from 2022 to 2050 (instead of 2015-2060 as per original code)
	- Changing name parameter '2_S_RECC_FinalProducts_2015_resbuildings' to '2_S_RECC_FinalProducts_2022_resbuildings'
	- Changing 115 to 122 when it has to be changed
	- Changing the Ind2015 to Ind_year and adding Year_Start
	- Changing 2015/2016 by using Year_Start
	- Run only until 2050 (instead of 2060) - adding Year_End
	
Infrastructure + connect the sectors together
	- Adding infrastructure, adding bitumen/asphalt
	- Two types of asphalt for the two layers (vegdekke, barelag)
	- Infrastructure maintenance fixed (maintaining only vegdekke)
	- Getting roads connected to res buildings
	- Getting pkm connected to res buildings and infrastructure
	- Adding alternatives pkm

Changes in the res buildings
	- Adding AB_standard archetype
	- Add district heating
	- Changes on energy res buildings
	- Fixing indirect emissions res buildings
	
About the results
	- Comment the plotting part
	- Disaggregation of results and reorganize the export

Other fixing/changes
	- Correcting error in reading 3_SHA_EnergyCarrierSplit_Vehicles
	- Disaggregation of concrete
	- Hydrogren fixed
	- Fixing forestry from Stefan as per commit ba3e2a4 in IndEcol/RECC-ODYM
	- Changing names of scenarios implied some changes in the code (like changing RCP2.6 to DEC)
